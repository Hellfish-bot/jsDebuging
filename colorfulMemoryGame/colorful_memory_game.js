        card.classList.add('card'); // It adds a class 'card' to the newly created 'div' element using card.classList.add('card'). This class might contain CSS styles or rules to style the card elements.
        card.dataset.color = color; // It sets the 'dataset.color' attribute of the card element to the current color value from the 'cards' array. This icon represents the card's hidden color until the player clicks it.
        card.textContent = '?'; // The text content of each card is initially set to a question mark ('?') using the card.textContent = '?'. This represents that the color of the card is hidden until it's clicked by the player.
        gameContainer.appendChild(card);    // the newly created card element is attached to the 'gameContainer' element as a child. This action adds each card element to the game interface within the designated container.

// The shuffle() Function is responsible for shuffling the elements of an array in random order.

function shuffle(array) {   // Array parameter: It takes an array as an argument, which contains yet to be shuffled elements.
    for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {    // Shuffling process using loop through the array: The function starts by initiating a 'for' loop that iterates backward through the array starting from the last index
        const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));  // Random index selection: Within each iteration, it generates a random index 'j' using Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1)). This 'j' represents a random index within the array.
